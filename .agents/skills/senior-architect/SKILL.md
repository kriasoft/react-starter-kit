# Senior Architect

Complete toolkit for senior architect with modern tools and best practices.

## Quick Start

### Main Capabilities

This skill provides three core capabilities through automated scripts:

```bash
# Script 1: Architecture Diagram Generator
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py [options]

# Script 2: Project Architect
python scripts/project_architect.py [options]

# Script 3: Dependency Analyzer
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py [options]
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Architecture Diagram Generator

Automated tool for architecture diagram generator tasks.

**Features:**
