## Best Practices

### Schema Design
1. **Use meaningful names**: Clear, consistent naming conventions
2. **Choose appropriate data types**: Right-sized columns for storage efficiency
3. **Define proper constraints**: Foreign keys, check constraints, unique indexes
4. **Consider future growth**: Plan for scale from the beginning
5. **Document relationships**: Clear foreign key relationships and business rules

### Performance Optimization
1. **Index strategically**: Cover common query patterns without over-indexing
2. **Monitor query performance**: Regular analysis of slow queries
3. **Partition large tables**: Improve query performance and maintenance
4. **Use appropriate isolation levels**: Balance consistency with performance
5. **Implement connection pooling**: Efficient resource utilization

### Security Considerations
1. **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
2. **Encrypt sensitive data**: At rest and in transit
3. **Audit access patterns**: Monitor and log database access
4. **Validate inputs**: Prevent SQL injection attacks
5. **Regular security updates**: Keep database software current

## Query Generation Patterns

### SELECT with JOINs

```sql
-- INNER JOIN: only matching rows
SELECT o.id, c.name, o.total
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.id = o.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: all left rows, NULLs for non-matches
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name;

-- Self-join: hierarchical data (employees/managers)
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON m.id = e.manager_id;
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
-- Recursive CTE for org chart
WITH RECURSIVE org AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS depth
  FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, o.depth + 1
  FROM employees e INNER JOIN org o ON o.id = e.manager_id
)
SELECT * FROM org ORDER BY depth, name;
```

### Window Functions

```sql
-- ROW_NUMBER for pagination / dedup
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS rn
FROM orders;

-- RANK with gaps, DENSE_RANK without gaps
SELECT name, score, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank FROM leaderboard;

-- LAG/LEAD for comparing adjacent rows
SELECT date, revenue,
  revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS daily_change
FROM daily_sales;
```

### Aggregation Patterns

```sql
-- FILTER clause (PostgreSQL) for conditional aggregation
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') AS active,
  AVG(amount) FILTER (WHERE amount > 0) AS avg_positive
FROM accounts;

-- GROUPING SETS for multi-level rollups
SELECT region, product, SUM(revenue)
FROM sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((region, product), (region), ());
```

## Migration Patterns

### Up/Down Migration Scripts

Every migration must have a reversible counterpart. Name files with a timestamp prefix for ordering:

```
migrations/
├── 20260101_000001_create_users.up.sql
├── 20260101_000001_create_users.down.sql
├── 20260115_000002_add_users_email_index.up.sql
└── 20260115_000002_add_users_email_index.down.sql
```

### Zero-Downtime Migrations (Expand/Contract)

Use the expand-contract pattern to avoid locking or breaking running code:

1. **Expand** — add the new column/table (nullable, with default)
2. **Migrate data** — backfill in batches; dual-write from application
3. **Transition** — application reads from new column; stop writing to old
4. **Contract** — drop old column in a follow-up migration

### Data Backfill Strategies

```sql
-- Batch update to avoid long-running locks
UPDATE users SET email_normalized = LOWER(email)
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email_normalized IS NULL LIMIT 5000);
-- Repeat in a loop until 0 rows affected
```

### Rollback Procedures

- Always test the `down.sql` in staging before deploying `up.sql` to production
- Keep rollback window short — if the contract step has run, rollback requires a new forward migration
- For irreversible changes (dropping columns with data), take a logical backup first

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategies

| Index Type | Use Case | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **B-tree** (default) | Equality, range, ORDER BY | `CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);` |
| **GIN** | Full-text search, JSONB, arrays | `CREATE INDEX idx_docs_body ON docs USING gin(to_tsvector('english', body));` |
| **GiST** | Geometry, range types, nearest-neighbor | `CREATE INDEX idx_locations ON places USING gist(coords);` |
| **Partial** | Subset of rows (reduce size) | `CREATE INDEX idx_active ON users(email) WHERE active = true;` |
| **Covering** | Index-only scans | `CREATE INDEX idx_cov ON orders(customer_id) INCLUDE (total, created_at);` |

### EXPLAIN Plan Reading

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT) SELECT ...;
```

Key signals to watch:
- **Seq Scan** on large tables — missing index
- **Nested Loop** with high row estimates — consider hash/merge join or add index
- **Buffers shared read** much higher than **hit** — working set exceeds memory

### N+1 Query Detection

Symptoms: application issues one query per row (e.g., fetching related records in a loop).

Fixes:
- Use `JOIN` or subquery to fetch in one round-trip
- ORM eager loading (`select_related` / `includes` / `with`)
- DataLoader pattern for GraphQL resolvers

### Connection Pooling

| Tool | Protocol | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **PgBouncer** | PostgreSQL | Transaction/statement pooling, low overhead |
| **ProxySQL** | MySQL | Query routing, read/write splitting |
| **Built-in pool** (HikariCP, SQLAlchemy pool) | Any | Application-level pooling |

**Rule of thumb:** Set pool size to `(2 * CPU cores) + disk spindles`. For cloud SSDs, start with `2 * vCPUs` and tune.

### Read Replicas and Query Routing

- Route all `SELECT` queries to replicas; writes to primary
- Account for replication lag (typically <1s for async, 0 for sync)
- Use `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` to detect lag before reading critical data

## Multi-Database Decision Matrix

| Criteria | PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQLite | SQL Server |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Best for** | Complex queries, JSONB, extensions | Web apps, read-heavy workloads | Embedded, dev/test, edge | Enterprise .NET stacks |
| **JSON support** | Excellent (JSONB + GIN) | Good (JSON type) | Minimal | Good (OPENJSON) |
| **Replication** | Streaming, logical | Group replication, InnoDB cluster | N/A | Always On AG |
| **Licensing** | Open source (PostgreSQL License) | Open source (GPL) / commercial | Public domain | Commercial |
| **Max practical size** | Multi-TB | Multi-TB | ~1 TB (single-writer) | Multi-TB |

**When to choose:**
- **PostgreSQL** — default choice for new projects; best extensibility and standards compliance
- **MySQL** — existing MySQL ecosystem; simple read-heavy web applications
- **SQLite** — mobile apps, CLI tools, unit test databases, IoT/edge
- **SQL Server** — mandated by enterprise policy; deep .NET/Azure integration

### NoSQL Considerations

| Database | Model | Use When |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **MongoDB** | Document | Schema flexibility, rapid prototyping, content management |
| **Redis** | Key-value / cache | Session store, rate limiting, leaderboards, pub/sub |
| **DynamoDB** | Wide-column | Serverless AWS apps, single-digit-ms latency at any scale |

> Use SQL as default. Reach for NoSQL only when the access pattern clearly benefits from it.

## Sharding & Replication

### Horizontal vs Vertical Partitioning

- **Vertical partitioning**: Split columns across tables (e.g., separate BLOB columns). Reduces I/O for narrow queries.
- **Horizontal partitioning (sharding)**: Split rows across databases/servers. Required when a single node cannot hold the dataset or handle the throughput.

### Sharding Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Hash** | `shard = hash(key) % N` | Even distribution | Resharding is expensive |
| **Range** | Shard by date or ID range | Simple, good for time-series | Hot spots on latest shard |
| **Geographic** | Shard by user region | Data locality, compliance | Cross-region queries are hard |

### Replication Patterns

| Pattern | Consistency | Latency | Use Case |
|---------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Synchronous** | Strong | Higher write latency | Financial transactions |
| **Asynchronous** | Eventual | Low write latency | Read-heavy web apps |
| **Semi-synchronous** | At-least-one replica confirmed | Moderate | Balance of safety and speed |
