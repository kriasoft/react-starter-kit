## Getting Started

### Requirements

  * Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v5.0 or newer
  * `npm` v3.3 or newer (new to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?)
  * `node-gyp` prerequisites mentioned [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
  * Text editor or IDE pre-configured with React/JSX/Flow/ESlint ([learn more](./how-to-configure-text-editors.md))

### Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of React Starter Kit (RSK) on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o react-starter-kit -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

Alternatively, you can start a new project based on RSK right from
[WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/create-new-project-react-starter-kit.html),
or by using [Yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-react-fullstack).

#### 2. Run `npm install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `npm start`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`) and [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
with [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

Note that the `npm start` command launches the app in `development` mode,
the compiled output files are not optimized and minimized in this case.
You can use `--release` command line argument to check how your app works
in release (production) mode:

```shell
$ npm start -- --release
```

### How to Build, Test, Deploy

If you need just to build the app (without running a dev server), simply run:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

or, for a production build:

```shell
$ npm run build -- --release
```

After running this command, the `/build` folder will contain the compiled
version of the app. For example, you can launch Node.js server normally by
running `node build/server.js`.

To check the source code for syntax errors and potential issues run:

```shell
$ npm run lint
```

To launch unit tests:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Test any javascript module by creating a `__tests__/` directory where
the file is. Append `-test.js` to the filename and
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) will do the rest.

To deploy the app, run:

```shell
$ npm run deploy
```

The deployment script `tools/deploy.js` is configured to push the contents of
the `/build` folder to a remote server via Git. You can easily deploy your app
to [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/),
or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) this way. Both will execute `npm install --production`
upon receiving new files from you. Note, you should only deploy the contents
of the `/build` folder to a remote server.

### How to Update

If you need to keep your project up to date with the recent changes made to RSK,
you can always fetch and merge them from [this repo](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)
back into your own project by running:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git fetch react-starter-kit
$ git merge react-starter-kit/master
$ npm install
```
